Hi! My name is Rose Hoover, and I am a senior at Mount Holyoke College majoring in Data Science with a minor in Economics.

I love to let statistics and data visualization guide my decision-making process, and I'm passionate about all things customer experience. I enjoy working on projects that combine code, creativity, and have real-world applications.

In my free time, I love to explore outdoors! You can find me rock climbing or hiking on local trails when the weather is nice
